# Emofunge

Emofunge-21 (or Emofunge for short) is a programming language inspired by Befunge, but with native Unicode support. All of the instructions have been replaced with emoji and other special characters, leaving you the entirety of the ASCII plane to do whatever you want in the comments. It also adds many commands not found in the original Befunge, as well as command modifiers.
